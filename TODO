DEFO:

* magnitude applied to each "string" when plucked should be determined by speed of swipe, not Y position.
* integrate auto-rotation code from WaveShaper
* try out using apple sliders on the toolbar
*** if they look ugly in context, then at very least replace slider labels with better font
* make a splash screen (iPhone, iPhone Retina, iPad, iPad Retina)
* make an icon (all resolutions)

MAYBE:

* look into how to do shaders for OpenGL ES 2.0 so maybe we can have fullscreen anti-alias
* add a recording function.
* add sharing to soundcloud
* add sharing to dropbox
* add sharing to audio-paste
* idea for sharing: create a library that provides a super straight-forward interface
	to sharing using typical methods for use in multiple apps. open source it if possible.
